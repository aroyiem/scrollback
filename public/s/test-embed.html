			Do you want a jelly baby? Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye... Fancypants! I don't like it. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.

			Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Hello-o-o-o. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon.

			Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. But not impossible.

			Why can't you leave me alone?! You know Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms. I think it's time to find your Achilles heel, or should I say - flipper. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost. Physician, heal thyself. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.

			Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's...

			So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room! That's the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. Lots of planets have a North. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.

			Jo, you’ve got all the time in the world… and all the space. I'm offering them to you. t's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That’s okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. The waves of time wash us all clean. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. Think about me when you're living your life one day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless traveller and his old police box, with his days like crazy paving.

			The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. I am the Doctor! The original you might say! Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.

			Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. You were expecting someone else? Mortuaries and larders. Easiest things to break out of. Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Don't you think she looks tired? Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. Sorry, must dash! Butterfingers.

			If I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, then I shall be happy indeed. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. Don't you think she looks tired? Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Subject for catalogue: file under 'imagination, comma, lack of'. t's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That’s okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. Oh, my giddy aunt! And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.

			The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too! Mmmm… what's that m'boy? There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere.

			Oh my word! Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Please just... just see me. Powerful! Crush the lesser races! Conquer the galaxy! UNIMAGINABLE POWER! UNLIMITED RICE PUDDING! Et cetera! Et cetera! Well Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home... and this is no place like home. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guidebook, you've got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me?

			Dreams are important…never underestimate them. You ain't seen nothing yet! Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! It's all right for you, Peri. You've only got one life. You'll age here in the TARDIS and then die. But me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent.

			It's all right for you, Peri. You've only got one life. You'll age here in the TARDIS and then die. But me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent. Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Reverse the polarity of… Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

			As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! Oh, my giddy aunt! There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do.

			How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? ...history sometimes gives us a terrible shock, and that is because we don't quite fully understand. Why should we? After all, we're too small to realise its final pattern. Therefore don't try and judge it from where you stand. I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls. Yes, well, the definition of the word 'humanity' is always a rather complex question, isn’t it?

			My last incarnation…oh, I was never happy with that one. It had a sort of feckless 'charm' which simply wasn't me. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. A knight of the GRAND ORDER OF OBERON! Only I would be stupid enough to attack such a person! Now would you stand aside before I shoot myself? Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Mmmmm…. I'm half human. On my mother's side. Goodbye, Clara.

			Run. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. This is a situation that requires tact and finesse. Fortunately, I am blessed with both. So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room! The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Eight minutes is ages. What if I get bored? Give me knitting.

			Well Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home... and this is no place like home. The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. I think I might have miscalculated. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick.

			It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon. Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? Come along, Pond! You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it. You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies. Nice to meet you, Rose. Doctor no more. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.

			Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? Jo, you’ve got all the time in the world… and all the space. I'm offering them to you. I'm a Doctor… though probably not the one that you were expecting Are you taller? Why? Do you have to reach a high shelf? I am the Doctor! The original, you might say!

			My ship…my TARDIS… Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. Don't be lasagna. I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Low tech? Grace, this is a type 40 TARDIS, able to take you to any planet in the universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics.

			If I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, then I shall be happy indeed. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Goodbye, Clara. This is a situation that requires tact and finesse. Fortunately, I am blessed with both. Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier.

			Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I! My writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Lots of planets have a North. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Life depends on change and renewal. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted.

			Reverse the polarity of… Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. Did I? It must be the carrot juice making me colour blind! Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? Low tech? Grace, this is a type 40 TARDIS, able to take you to any planet in the universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics.

			No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal. You don't understand so you find excuses. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. I've reversed the polarity of the Neutron flow, so the TARDIS should be free from the force field now. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation.

			Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Did I? It must be the carrot juice making me colour blind! Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? I know who I am, I… AM… THE DOCTOR! I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. Smith. Doctor John Smith. You're standing on my scarf. I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too!
